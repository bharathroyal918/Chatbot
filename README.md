Chatbot UI with Groq API and Gradio
This project implements a simple interactive chatbot interface using Gradio and the Groq API for conversational AI. It leverages a large language model (openai/gpt-oss-20b) hosted by Groq to generate responses in a streaming manner.

Components and Flow
1. Imports and Dependencies
gradio for the frontend chat UI.

groq client library to communicate with the Groq API.

userdata from Google Colab for securely accessing environment variables (specifically the Groq API key).

2. generate_chat_response function
This is the core function that:

Receives a user message and chat history (list of tuples (user_message, bot_message)).

Retrieves the Groq API key from the Colab environment.

Initializes a Groq client with the API key.

Converts the chat history into the format expected by the Groq API (a list of messages with roles: user or assistant).

Appends the current user message to the history.

Calls the Groq API to generate streaming completions:

Uses parameters like temperature, max_tokens, and top_p to control generation.

Yields partial responses as they stream in, enabling real-time UI updates.

Handles API errors gracefully and logs unexpected exceptions.

3. Gradio ChatInterface
Uses gr.ChatInterface to create a clean chat UI.

Connects the interface to the generate_chat_response function.

Sets a title and description for the UI.

Provides example inputs to help users get started.

Applies a "soft" theme for visual style.

4. Launching the app
Runs the Gradio app with server_name="0.0.0.0" to allow access from any IP (useful for cloud environments).

Debug mode is enabled to assist with development and troubleshooting.

Usage
To run this app:

Make sure you have the required Python packages installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install gradio groq
Set your Groq API key in your environment (for Google Colab, store it using userdata or export as environment variable).

Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Open the provided URL in your browser to chat with the model.

Notes
The Groq client requires a valid API key to function. Ensure your key is set correctly, or the app will print an error.

The script streams responses from the API to the UI, making conversations feel natural and responsive.

max_tokens is set to a high value (4096) to allow long responses but can be adjusted based on use case and token limits.

This script is designed to run in environments like Google Colab but can be adapted for local or other cloud environments with appropriate API key management.

Possible Improvements
Add input validation and UI feedback for missing or invalid API keys.

Support conversation resets or clearing history.

Enhance error handling with UI messages instead of console prints.

Add more examples or custom system prompts to guide the assistant.
